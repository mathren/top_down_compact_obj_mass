    "# Introduction\n",
    "We want to develop a new mapping between star (and core) mass and compact object remnant for rapid population synthesis calculations.\n",
    "Our aim is to have one way to calculate this across the entire mass range (from neutron stars to above the pair-instability black hole mass gap).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we want the mapping to be continuous. This is not because it is a priori unphysical to have discontinuities, but because we don't want to artificially introduce features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to calculate the mass of the compact object remnant as total mass minus varius mass loss terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M_\\mathrm{remnant} = M_\\mathrm{tot} - \\left( \\Delta M_\\mathrm{PPI} + \\Delta M_\\mathrm{NLW} + \\Delta M_\\mathrm{SN} + \\Delta M_{\\nu, \\mathrm{core}} + \\Delta M_\\mathrm{lGRB} + \\cdots \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, pre-explosion binary interactions reduce $M_\\mathrm{tot}$ already (and possibly modify the core masses), and then each mass loss process at core-collapse can be added separately.\n",
    "This can also be extended to add, say, long gamma-ray burst mass loss (as a function of core-spin), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while \"building\" the compact object mass from the bottom up (e.g., the [Fryer et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749...91F/abstract) approach of starting with a proto neutron star\n",
    "mass and accrete the fallback on it) makes it very difficult to use observationally informed values for some of the terms in parenthesis. Conversely, in our approach of \"building\" the compact object by removing\n",
    "from the total mass the ejecta, we can easily use observationally informed quantities for each term here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one (or more) of these terms have a stochastic component, this can naturally produce the scatter in compact object masses expected because of the stochasticity in supernova explosions \n",
    "(e.g., [Mandel & Mueller 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3214M/abstract)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we explain and calculate each mass loss term separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pulsational-pair instability mass loss $\\Delta M_\\mathrm{PPI}\\equiv M_\\mathrm{PPI}(M_\\mathrm{CO})$\n",
    "\n",
    "This term represents the amount of mass lost in pulsational pair-instability SNe. Although the delay times between pulses (and core-collapse) can be very long (especially at the highest mass end),\n",
    "this is treated as instantaneous mass loss at the time of core-collapse in rapid population synthesis calculations. We do not improve on this here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many codes use the fit from [Farmer et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887...53F/abstract) which however is\n",
    "discontinuous with [Fyer et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749...91F/abstract) typically used for core-collapse SNe.\n",
    "However, this is not a fit to the amount of mass *lost*, which is what we need here. One is provided in [Renzo et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...640A..56R/abstract), \n",
    "but it does not contain the metallicity dependence, which is desirable.\n",
    "Thus, we re-fit the Z-dependent data from [Farmer et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887...53F/abstract). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, `datafile1.txt` is a cleaned up version of `datafile1.txt` available on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3346593).\n",
    "We note that [Farmer et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887...53F/abstract) simulated only He cores,\n",
    "and [Renzo et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...640A..56R/abstract) showed that the H-rich envelope,\n",
    "if present, is likely to fly away during the first pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore to the amount of mass loss $\\Delta M_\\mathrm{PPI}$ we fit here one should *add any residual H-rich envelope present in the star at the time of pulsations*."
